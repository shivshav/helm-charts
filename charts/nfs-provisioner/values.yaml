  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

  #  cpu: 100m
  #  memory: 128Mi
  # requests:

# If not provided, affinity will be used instead as the pod should only be scheduled onto a node with the proper host paths configured with a storage backend
