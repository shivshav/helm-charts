Your keepalive virtual IP daemon is now running. It has been configured to expose these services:
{{- range $ip, $service := .Values.services }}
  {{ $ip }} -----> {{ $service }}
{{- end }}
Note: Make sure the IP addresses supplied aren't used by any other devices on your local network

If you need to expose another service in the future, just update your values configuration with the new service/IP combination and run
  helm upgrade -f <config-file> shiv/keepalived-vip <release-name>
